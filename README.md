🃏 Blackjack Game (Python)
This is a simple command-line Blackjack game written in Python, created as a university project. 
The game follows standard Blackjack rules, allowing the player to hit, stand, or double down against the dealer.
Note: This project was developed using Thonny, a beginner-friendly Python IDE. You can run the script in any Python 3.x environment.
